Attention! Any changes you make will void your warranty for this device! The author is not responsible for any damage resulting from any actions of the user!
### Disassembling

Currently, the camera only supports flashing via UART adapter, so we туув to disassemble the camera to perform the operations. **Remember that this will void your manufacturer's warranty!**

We will need:
- The device
- Hairdryer or another heater
- A flat, thin object, such as a utility knife
- Long thin x-type screwdriver
- Accuracy

So, let's go:
1) Gently warm up the front of the camera (where the lens is)
2) Using a utility knife or other pointed object, carefully pry off the front part. Remember, there are important wires under the front, ***don't damage them!***
3) Working in a circle, carefully separate the front part from the camera body. ***Remember that it is wired to the main board of the camera!***
4) Under the bottom you will find two screws that need to be removed. After that, carefully separate the halves of the camera body. Be careful not to hurt yourself or damage the connecting wires or parts of the camera!
